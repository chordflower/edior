# Distribution

This document discusses the distribution strategies for editor.

## Overview

The distribution directory is dist in the project root, and contains the following formats:

- zip => The distribution in a zip format, without the jre;
- tar.gz => The distribution in a tar.gz format, without the jre;
- tar.bz2 => The distribution in a tar.bz2 format, without the jre;
- tar.xz => The distribution in a tar.xz format, without the jre;
- win64-jre.zip => The distribution in a windows executable with a x64 bits jre bundled;
- win64.zip => The distribution in a windows executable with a x64 bits jre bundled;
- mac-jre.dmg => The distribution in a macOS executable with a x64 jre bundled;
- mac.dmg => The distribution in a macOS executable without a jre bundled;

There are no specific linux builds, just use one of the tarballs on linux.
